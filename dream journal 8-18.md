# dream journal 8-18

I had this horrible dream we're about a dozen of my closest friends shot themselves in the head and I saw everything and I had to clean it up and I had to take care of them and I was the one in charge of trying to stop them and they wouldn't stop and everyone I loved was dead I watched Dexter and Lydia and Myer and Ti and Willow and Chance and dr schnee and my grandma and a couple friends from church at school all shoot themselves in the head. it was so much


I went back to bed and had another dream about my cat Luna degloving my hand because I tried to pet her
