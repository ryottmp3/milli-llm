# Frybread

- Â¼ cup sugar
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup water (or just enough to make a soft dough)
- Oil for frying

Let dough set for like 30 minutes before making small frybreads. don't roll it and dont knead it too much, just get a good ball of dough and flatten with hands. sprinkle a lot of flour on the breadboard before balling and flattening so it wont be sticky. Only fry for 15 - 20 sec each side
