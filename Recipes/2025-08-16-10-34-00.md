- Â¼ cup sugar
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 cups flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup water (or just enough to make a soft dough)
- Oil for frying

Mix all the dry ingredients together. Add water, mixing carefully. Divide the dough into four pieces and pat each into a round, flat shape. Add 1-2 inches of oil to a large skillet and heat to 350. Fry each round until crisp and brown on both sides.
