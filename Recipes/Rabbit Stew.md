# Rabbit Stew

- 3 tbsp corn flour
 - 2 tsp dried oregano or bergamot
 - 1 pinch sumac
- 1 pinch Sakari Botanicals Cedar smoked salt
 - 1 large rabbit, about 3 pounds, cut into 8 pieces
 - 3 tbsp Seka Hills Extra Virgin Olive Oil
 - 3 wild onions or 2 large onions, coarsely chopped
- 3 cups corn, rabbit or turkey stock
 - 1 cup soaked hominy

Put the flour, oregano and a generous pinch of sumac and smoked salt in a large freezer bag. Add the rabbit portions a few at a time, and shake generously to coat. Transfer to a plate.

Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot set over medium heat. Fry the rabbit a few pieces at a time, until golden brown. Put the pieces in a baking dish. Add onions to the pot and sauté until lightly browned and beginning to soften, about 5 minutes.

Pour 1 cup of the stock into the cooking pot and stir vigorously to deglaze any of the browned bits in the pot. Simmer for a few seconds and add the remaining stock and hominy. Return rabbit to the pot, partially cover and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, turning rabbit pieces occasionally until meat is tender, about 2-2½ hours. Skim off and discard any fat that rises to the top as the rabbit cooks. Serve the rabbit stew over corn mush or wild rice.
