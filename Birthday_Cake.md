# Birthday Cake

## 1 -- Emily

When I woke up this morning, I didn’t think that today would be anything special. It was just another winter Tuesday in my little town. I mean, sure, there was riots in all of the cities and shit was going down, but the cities are hundreds of miles away. Nothing ever happens out here. Hell, the biggest thing that I remember happening was that horrible accident on the highway a few years back. A semi-truck carrying fruit ran head-first into a streetlight on the side of the road, and the trailer jack-knifed, rolled, and spilled thousands of pounds of fresh fruit over Highway 79. The truck driver survived, but old Jimmy Pedersen, the town’s veterinarian, had to stitch him up since the doctor was on vacation and he didn’t want to travel back to Regional for stitches.

But I guess today’s gotta take the cake for the most eventful day I remember. I was in the yard chopping wood when I first saw them: a string of National Guard trucks coming in from Rapid. I figured they were doing some exercise down by Hot Springs or just transporting them out to Denver or wherever the Orange Diva wanted them next. Upsetting, but nothing too out of the ordinary. Ever since the DNC was abolished as a “terror organization” in 2025, the GOP had been occupying every major and medium city across the country, locking up anyone who dared speak against the regime. I moved out to the country then, hoping it would keep me safe. And it did. When they started rounding up protestors in Rapid, they conveniently assumed everyone in the tiny towns were their allies, or at least weren’t a worry to them. But I guess that changed.

The line of a dozen or so army trucks stopped at the gas station and parked in some grid formation around Noon.  I figured they were getting diesel or whatever. But then, they came into town. They started knocking down doors and coming into peoples houses, under the guise of “finding dangerous leftist extremist stowaways”.  The first house they raided was the Menendez’s place. They were the only Hispanic family in town, and so of course they were targeted. After they rounded up their whole family, they went down the street and to the next and the next, clearing the whole town of anyone who didn’t give off MAGA vibes. I had gotten rid of my smart phone a while back, so I got updates via my home phone. 

When they came to my house they tossed the entire place and (of course) came up empty. They didn’t find Lillith or Steven or anyone, because my storm cellar’s entrance was covered in undisturbed snow. However, they did take me by the arm and shove me into their jeep. I couldn’t struggle, they would probably just shoot me. I quietly complied and awaited what I thought would surely be certain death. I don’t even know what flagged them to grab me. It was probably my old social media data I tried to scrub, but Palantir had already had me profiled, so that was a waste of time.

The jeep was cold as fuck. Apparently, the army vehicles were all in disarray and the heaters only worked in half of them. I don’t know why I expected an administration who cares so little for their people to care any more for their soldiers. They drove me to where they had all the others and ordered me to get out and stand with them. I counted 16 others there, shivering in the winter wind. Sally, the hairstylist, had been showering when they broke down her door. They didn’t even let her dress—she was only wearing a frozen towel and her hair was a crown of icicles. She’d been standing out here long enough for her fingers to be blue. I was scared she wouldn’t make it. I had been more prepared, so I was wearing a heavy winter jacket and scarf. Mr. Pedersen, on the other hand, was still in his white coat. The Menendez kids, 5 and 8, were trying not to cry while their parents did what they could to comfort them without angering  the soldiers. I was trying not to cry myself. We were all going to die now. Whether we died here from exposure or in a couple months in Prospector’s Pen, the ICE Detention Center just south of Deadwood, there definitely wasn’t going to be a way out.

After standing in the freezing cold for about an hour, there was an unintelligible warble on the guardsmen’s radios. A brief meeting between some of them resulted in all but four of them taking off back toward Rapid. They left four heavily armed soldiers with the 20 or so of us, which was obviously a tactical fumble on their part, I think. I’m not sure. They could mow us down easily, so maybe not.

That was a half an hour or so ago. The main troop would have to have been in Rapid by now for sure. I don’t know how long they’re going to have us stand here, but I need to piss.  Sally doesn’t look like she’s doing too good, and I heard the soldiers joking about making her drop her towel. I can’t believe that these horrible masked men have families to go home to. How can they do these things then kiss their wife after? It’s disgusting. I definitely wouldn’t kiss a man who did this for a living, or even someone who thought something like this was okay. That’s probably why I’m still single lol. 

I had had a fling with Lillith for a while, but with everything going on, she didn’t want any attachments in case she had to disappear. I get it, but she’s still living in my storm shelter. I hope she can stay hidden. 

The soldiers are all geared up with mittens and warm hats, joking off to the side about 15 yards away from the group. What fucking cowards. They can’t even face the people they’re condemning. One of them tells the others to watch, makes a snowball and throws it at us with the force of a baseball pitcher. It hits the youngest Menendez kid right in the face. He starts bawling, nad the same soldier walks up to Amy, the kid’s mother, and slaps her in the face. 

“Control your kid, beaner whore.” The man sneers and spits in her face before turning around and walking back toward the other soldiers, laughing.

*CRACK!* 

The soldier drops to the ground, steaming red blood spurting all over the trampled snow. All of us hostages or prisoners or whatever we are duck down low so we won’t get caught in any crossfire. As I look up, I se the other soldiers running to take cover behind the engine block of the big truck that they were presumptively going to load us into. Taking advantage of the chaos, Joe and Clara Martin, both teachers at the highschool, start running away from the truck and back toward the gas station. They don’t even get halfway before one of the soldiers opens fire and takes them both down. Nobody else moves a muscle. It’s life or death.

*CRACK!*

Another shot rings out, this one striking the windshield of the truck, shattering it. The soldiers start returning fire toward the top of the hill across the highway, but the snow blowing in the wind makes it impossible to tell if that’s where the shots are actually coming from. 

*CRACK!*

Another soldier falls, one who would have been protected if the shooter was on the hill. The other two scramble towards us, ordering us to get in the back of the truck. We start to move into the truck’s covered back, making sure that those who are in the worst shape get in first.

*CRACK!*

I’m last in line. The soldier behind me shoves me hard, shouting to hurry. I glance once over my shoulder — snow whipping sideways, the other soldier firing blindly into the white blur. The sound is deafening, echo bouncing off the gas station, off the trees. Nobody can even tell where the shooter really is.

*CRACK!*

Glass explodes somewhere. Shouts. A stray round zings off the bumper, sending sparks into the slush. I duck instinctively, climbing onto the tailgate.

*CRACK!*

Something punches through my side, and involuntarily, I let out a scream as white fire tearing all the air out of me. For a second I don’t even—

“FUCK!” I thought. I missed again. I can barely see what I’m aiming at through the blowing snow. I cycle my bolt, aiming at the muzzle flash of the guardsman firing blindly in all directions.

I take a deep breath in and hold it for a second like my grandpa had taught me. I breathe out and as I hit the bottom of my lungs, I pull the trigger.

*CRACK!*

My ears rang louder. I left my house in such a hurry that I didn’t even grab any earpro. I see sparks fly to the left and below where I was aiming. Wind gust must hve grabbed it. Cycling my bolt again, I take another breath. The soldier was now firing almost directly toward me, so I’m guessing he must have seen my muzzle flash. The 5.56 bullets whiz past me close enough for me to hear them over my growing tinnitus. Holding just right and above the soldier, I let my finger drop. I’ve donp this dozens of times before, but it was always deer or antelope or coyotes, and those don’t have M-4s.

*CRACK!*

I hear a woman let out a single fleeting scream before the other soldier slams the tailgate shut and screams to the other to go. Cycling the bolt, I go to try one last shot, but I’m out of ammunition.

I can tell where my casings had landed because of the little holes they left in the snow. I scoop them up and make sure I could count all six before I shove them in my pocket. It’s frigid out. I can feel ice starting to form on my mustache as the kidnapping truck pulls out of the parking lot and onto the highway, rolling back toward Rapid City. I was leaned over the peak of a dormer on the roof of the gas station, about a football field away from where the truck had stood. I straighten myself out, throw my grandpa’s old Carcano over my shoulder and shimmy down to the edge of the roof. Holding onto the edge, I drop down to the ground below. 

Immediately, pain shoots through my hip as my feet slip from below me. I land on a patch of snow-covered ice and take a second to regain my composure before standing. Using one of the pillars to steady myself, I start running toward the bodies to see if I could render any first aid.­

Everything is still now. Eerily still. Joe and Clara lay slumped in a pile near the pumps. They spent their dying moments in an embrace. Fuck, it was kinda poetic. They had just gotten their marriage put back together after Joe's infidelity had put it on the ritz. 

Big, fluffy snowflakes float down ever so softly, illuminated by the orange glow of the streetlamps. It's like a scene out of a Christmas romance flick, except the reality is so much more grim.
